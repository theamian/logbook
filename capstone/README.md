# CoolDiveSite

CoolDiveSite is a capstone project for Harvard's [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). 

It's a simple diving logbook which allows you to register, choose a dive site by clicking on a map or using Google's search box and fill out your logbook.

The project demonstrates using Python framework Django for the back end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and Jinja2 to piece both together. It also displays integration with Google Maps JavaScript and Geocoding APIs.
